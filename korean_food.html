          <h3>Chicken Dolsot Bibimbap with Kimchi</h3>
          <p>Chicken dolsot bibimbap is personally my favorite Korean dish!
            The stone pot it arrives in usually is sizzling,
            bringing out the aromas of the ingredients, alongside the chicken being tender,
             and the veggies retaining its freshness and crunch. I especially love how the
             stone pot allows the rice at the bottom to crisp up, giving the extra texture and
             flavor. The best part of a bibimbap is when you mix everything together, as that's
             how it is typically eaten. The gochujang coating every bite and every component of
             the dish meshing makes it feel comforting and completed. As this is my go to order,
             I sometimes have kimchi on the side, which is perfect for cutting through the richness.

          <h3>Bulgogi - Grilled and marinated Korean beef with a mixture of Korean soy sauce,
            sesame oil, garlic, red pepper, onion, mushroom, and zucchini </h3>
          <p>If I decide to try something different, I like to alternate by ordering bulgogi.
            It never fails to come out steaming, with the smell of the sweet and savory marinade
            hitting right away. Just like the chicken from the bibimbap, the beef always remains
            tender and juicy and the onions and veggies are cooked until they are slightly crisp,
            balancing the softness of the meat. Every bite never fails to be perfect, especially
            when combining it with rice or kimchi. Bulgogi can be quite filling, so including side
            dishes with it, elevates the experience to a completely different level.
